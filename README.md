# Iris Species Prediction (MA515 Project)

This project implements a complete machine-learning pipeline to predict **Iris flower species** (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using statistical methods and classification algorithms. The project was developed as part of the **MA515 – Foundations of Data Science** course.

---

## Project Overview

The goal is to build a classifier that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on four features:

- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**

The project includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature visualization
- Model training using multiple algorithms
- Accuracy comparison
- Final model prediction on unseen data

## ▶️ Running the Project: Run following commands in your terminal

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
python program.py
